# 🌐 USE BROWSER JUPYTER (Guaranteed to Show Output)

Since Cursor isn't showing output, let's use browser Jupyter instead. This **WILL** show output!

## Step 1: Open Terminal in Cursor

1. In Cursor, press: **`Ctrl+` `** (backtick) to open terminal
2. Or: **View → Terminal**

## Step 2: Run These Commands

Copy and paste these one by one:

```bash
cd /Users/user/Documents/Quant-Finance-Project1
source .venv/bin/activate
jupyter notebook
```

## Step 3: Browser Opens Automatically

- Your **default browser** will open
- You'll see the Jupyter file browser
- Click on: **`american_call_mc_pricing.ipynb`**

## Step 4: Run Cells in Browser

1. Click on the **first code cell** (the test cell)
2. Press **`Shift+Enter`**
3. **Output will appear below the cell** - guaranteed!

## Step 5: See Your Output!

In browser Jupyter, output **ALWAYS** appears below cells. You'll see:
- Text output
- Plots
- Everything!

## To Stop Jupyter

- Go back to terminal
- Press **`Ctrl+C`** twice
- Or close the terminal

---

**This is a guaranteed way to see output!** The browser version always works. 🎯
